> This project is done as part of the Embedded Systems course [ELC2080] taught to second year Electronics and Elecrtic Communication Engineering Students at Cairo University Under the Supervision of Dr. Mohamed Riad.

### **[Dashboard Link](https://amirsameh1.github.io/test/)** To monitor project Data in real-time

## Brief Description

The system employs a dual-microcontroller setup to monitor and transmit water level data at two locations in a lake. The first module, positioned at the center where GSM signal is unavailable, measures water level and temperature, then relays the data via the ESP-NOW protocol to a second module stationed at the lakeâ€™s edge. This second unit consolidates the readings and transmits them to a base station using both GSM and Wi-Fi for broader connectivity.
